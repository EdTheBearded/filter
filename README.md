## Data Filter  ##
**Making my life easier is always a nice thing!**

A program that reads grmon log output, parse it (finding the data region,
enclosed by BEGIN DATA and END DATA, and generates a gnumeric table with the data.
Works with linux time shell command, parsing its real time, and custom time output, when formatted 'time %lf'.
